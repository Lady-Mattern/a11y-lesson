## The Case Story
Help! The Paglia Family Pizza parlor has just received a demand letter in regards to the pizza ordering process of their website. As it turns out, many customers filed a complaint that the ordering process was not accessible and they were frustrated because they were unable to place orders at all! 

The current Paglia Family Pizza website is pretty old so the restaurant owners have called upon us to create a new one from scratch that will allow customers with disabilities to successfully order pizzas.
